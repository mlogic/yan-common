# Ghostscript, sometimes the result might not be fully compliant but

Usage: $0 [options] src [dst]

Using the latest Ghostscript is highly recommended because old
versions -- especially before 2.11 -- have many bugs. Ghostscript
website provides easy-to-use static binaries for Linux.

If dst is missing, a file named src_distilled.pdf will be generated.

-a    PDF/A-2b (default).
-x    PDF/X.
-p    Do a pdf2ps pass first. WARNING: Use this only if other methods failed to
      generate compliant files for you. This generates the most compliant
      document but if any page of your document has transparent objects
      the whole page will be rasterized. Also PDF bookmarks and links
      will be lost.
-n    Do not use pdfdef.ps. This can be used to distill small figures
      that will be inserted into LaTeX documents to generate a
      compliant document.
